# Exploits And Hacks
This is a curated list of exploits for ChromeOS. It started with LTBEEF, and now there is more!
Many of these exploits can destory your computer if used inproperly. So PLEASE PLEASE make sure you follow these instructions very carefully!
If you need help ask it <a href="https://github.com/Brandon421-ops/Exploits-And-Hacks/discussions">here</a>

Note: Students to see the list of more exploits click on JPCMG [LTBEEF with Service workers and scroll down than click TerraOS and scroll down. Only if you are on my github.io website.
  
**ATTENTION ALL SYS ADMINS!!!**

Hello, I am Brandon and I forked this repo from <a href="https://github.com/3kh0/ext-remover">3kh0</a> in order to give updated and old exploits for the masses and to prove one thing, chromebooks are literal trash, and a poor excuse for a computer. They are full of exploits, you might think you blocked/patched them all but then 3 more pop up. It is a endless game of whack-a-mole. Treat your students to a windows computer, they will thank you. And don't you dare start to think "My school district does not have that kind of money", it most likely does! How much are you paying the blocker companies? Think about that.

<summary><b>LTMEAT</b> Freeze extensions</summary>

  **DO NOT UPDATE YOUR CHROMEBOOK TO CHROME VERSION 115 OR ABOVE**

**Patched** **On** **Chrome** **Versions** **115** **And** **above**

**L**iterally **T**he **M**eatiest **E**xploit of **A**ll **T**ime

From [ltmeat.bypassi.com](https://ltmeat.bypassi.com), if you are intrested in how this exploit works, check out that website.

1. Find a page belonging to the extension you want to disable. `chrome://extensions`, `chrome://extensions-internals`, and `chrome://process-internals` are all good places to find your extension's ID (a 32-character lowercase string). You can also just do a simple Google search. Once you have your ID, substitute it into the hostname in the URL below:

```
chrome-extension://extensionidhere/manifest.json
```

For some filters like Securly, the block screen is already an extension page. 

2. Bookmark the extension page (bookmark A) if you wish. Then, bookmark `chrome://kill` (B) and `chrome://hang` (C). 
3. While on the extension page (A), click the `chrome://kill` bookmark (B). The page should crash. You should already have the next step prepared. 
4. Instantly start spamming `chrome://hang` (bookmark C) and quickly reload the page while spamming (ideally with the refresh key on your keyboard or `ctrl`+`R`). You should have reloaded within one or two seconds of killing the page. 

If the extension page (bookmark A) no longer loads, then LTMEAT worked! You can close your tabs and the extension will basically be dead. If nothing loads, then you probably reloaded too late or spammed too slow. This isn't rocket science! Restart your computer to revert back to normal.

### "Help me! I'm an idiot!"

Turns out that I had far too much faith in society when making this page. Some of you skids out there are really, really stupid and also can't read. So here are the answers to some commonly asked questions. 

**How do I get an extension ID?**

Okay, fair. Extension IDs are leaked in a couple of places. Generally, the best way to get them is to go to extension settings and copy the URL query value.

**It says blocked by client?**

That's the message you get when you try to visit an a page belonging to an extension that doesn't exist. The error message (`ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT`) is extremely misleading. Nobody blocked it--you just need to find the right extension ID (see above).

If you got this because you tried to visit the `extension_id_here_please` example URL, you should be extremely ashamed of yourself. Please change and grow as a person. 

**I don't have a bookmarks bar!!!!**

First, try running ctrl+shift+B. If that doesn't work, go to `chrome://settings` and turn on the "home button" feature, then set it to `chrome://hang`. A home icon should show up to the right of your refresh icon in the top left. Use that instead of bookmark C.

There is a version where you don't need bookmarklets, but I am currently gatekeeping it (L). Check this site daily to see if new alternate instructions have been posted. 

**I disabled an extension but now I can't load websites!**

If you actually just read the writeup, you'd know that this would happen if the extension's background page loaded and its listeners were already initialized before you used `chrome://hang`. You can double-check whether the extension is listening using `chrome://extensions-internals`, assuming you have a few brain cells in your head.

Anyway, no listeners means you were too slow. Either you waited more than three seconds between bookmark B and reloading the page, or you weren't spamming bookmark C fast enough. The most reliable fix for this is to just restart your computer and try again. Try to match the pace of the gif below: (note the reload) 

![image](https://ltmeat.bypassi.com/img/abc.gif)

**The bookmarks don't do anything when I click them!**

Might be admin-blocked. Either be smart enough to figure out another way, or check this site daily to see if new alternate instructions have been posted.

**I disabled the extension, why is some stuff still blocked?**

I have bad news for you... not all filters are Chrome Extensions. And again, make sure the extension pages (like bookmark A) are frozen before you assume that your skiddy self successfully did the exploit.

<summary><b>Baby LTMEAT</b> Freeze extensions</summary>

**Patched On Chrome Versions 115 And Above**
  
BABY METHOD
FOR THE TECHNOLOGICALLY CHALLENGES.

1. Follow step one of the original instructions to find a page belonging to the Chrome extension you want to disable.

2. Visit that chrome-extension://blockeridhere page, then type chrome://hang in the URL bar of that tab. It should start loading infinitely.

3. Right-click the tab and duplicate it. Don't close anything.

4. Go to the chrome://extensions page for the blocker extension you want to Disable.

5. If that page has any sort of switch, such as "Allow access to file URLs", click that switch. If there are no clickable switches, cry in a corner or something.

The extension should now be broken, assuming you clicked the switch! Only one of the two duplicate tabs should be left standing. You can close your tabs now.

<summary><b>LTMEAT Flood</b> Freeze extensions</summary>

  **If your Chromebook has received the 115 And Above patch on the stable channel Then Here's A New Method For LTMEAT**
  
  
**Unpatched on 115 and above**

**L**iterally **T**he **M**eatiest **E**xploit of **A**ll **T**ime

1. Create a bookmark folder and paste the extension page lots of times. (About 1000 minimum is recommended assuming your Chromebook is average school quality) It is recommended that you add the extension page at the beginning of the folder.

2. Right click and open all in a new window.

3. Close the window with all those tabs.

4. Open the folder in a new window again, and Chrome should hang those tabs to take care of the old ones in the background that were just closed. (Equivalent to the duplicate tab step in Bypassi's method)

5. Flip the Allow access to file URLs switch in the extension settings and then you've bypassed the patch and the exploit is working.

6. Close everything and you're good to go. If it didn't work, try adjusting the number of open tabs. This is the LTMEAT Flood Method, and also unofficially called Alternate Method # 2. Enjoy a much longer life of LTMEAT!

**I literally don't have explanations for the strange behaviors of this exploit, but the general necessary tab amount seems to increase. Originally it was 600, then 800, now 1000.**

**Not working?** Ensure you open a large set, but not too large, of extension tabs (_/generated_background_page.html or /manifest.json) for a permanent freeze.

<summary><b>Baby LTMEAT Flood</b> Freeze extensions</summary>

**Unpatched on 115 and above**

1. First of all, get your folder with 800+ extension page tabs and open it in a new window, for my Chromebook i used 800 extension page tabs as i feel it's the right amount for me

2. Close the newly opened Window with 800+ extension page tabs

3. Click into your folder, and open one of the extension page tab in a new window, maybe waiting slightly longer this time, to confirm it worked. If it loads, you did it wrong. If you see a "page unresponsive screen, and a wait/exit page button" you did it right" But don't click either of the buttons. (if you want to do it fast you can just see that the page always has a spinning loading circle)

4. Now go to `chrome://extensions/?id=yourblockerID`  Then scroll down and flick the "allow access to file URLs" lever and close the window with the 1 extension page tab remaining.

<summary><b>LTVegan</b> Freeze extensions</summary>

1. Find your extension's largest file. This can usually be found by poking around in your extension's manifest.json or you can use <a href="https://robwu.nl/crxviewer/">Rob Wu's crxviewer</a> to find your extensions largest file.

2. open chrome://extensions/?id=IDHERE

3. CTRL+A to copy all of the code, then drag the copied text to the tabs bar. this may freeze your  chromebook a few times.

4. start clicking the chrome extension tab (chrome://extensions/?id=IDHERE ) a few times, then wait ( chromebook is currently frozen).

5. when your chromebook isn’t as frozen, right click the page that has the huge file tab and duplicate it.

6. click the “Allow access to file URLs” (multiple times for good measure) and the first tab should close itself. if BOTH tabs closed themselves, you did something wrong, or just try again.

7. you should be able to normally use your  Chromebook now. afaik you might be able to close the duplicated tab but I didn’t close it and it lasted for a long time.

<details>
<summary><b>Anesthesia</b> Freeze extensions with printing</summary>

1. Find your extension's largest file. This can usually be found by poking around in your extension's manifest.json or you can use <a href="https://robwu.nl/crxviewer/">Rob Wu's crxviewer</a> to find your extensions largest file.

2. Go to that page. and hit `Ctrl`+`P`. A print window shoudl show up, with a number of pages in the top right.

3. Do everything you can to increase that number. Shrink down margins, change layout to landscape, anything you can. The higher you can get that number, the longer the effect will last.

4 Hit reload. The page should start hanging.

5. Go to your extension's settings page. This is in `chrome://extensions`.

6. Duplicate your "printing" tab, and go back to your extension's settings page.

7. Flip any switch you can find there. Usually there'll be one titled "`Allow Access to File:// [URL]s`".

8. Presto! Go have fun on the (probably) unblocked web.

FAQ:
Where do I find my extension's manifest.json?
First find your extension's ID. This is a 32-character code that can be found in your extension's settings page, normally near or at the top. Then go to chrome-extension://your-32-char-id-goes-here/manifest.json

Credit to <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/bypassi">Bypassi</a> for the original LTMEAT framework, and HUGE thanks to Swordmaster4321 for discovering that pages can be hanged with printing.

<summary><b>Corkey</b> Corrupt extensions</summary>

**Corkey does indeed include power washing the Chromebook, which wipes local data including everything under "My files," so I suggest you select everything you want to drag and back up to Google Drive if that's available for your account.**

**Chromebooks Only**

1. `Esc`+`Refresh`+`Power` and re-enroll (Enter recovery page) or you can just powerwash

2. log into your chromebook and immediately turn off wifi and do `refresh`+`power` to (instant restart)

3. Log back into your chromebook with the wifi off. There should be something on the side of the connect wifi page that says log in offline or sign in as a existing user.

4. Go to `chrome://extensions`, turn on wifi, and wait for your schools blocking extension to appear.

5. As soon as it appears turn off wifi and instant restart as fast as you can.

6. Log back in and go back to extensions and wait. If it says your blocking extension could be corrupted or doesnt appear at all then it worked (wait atleast a minute with a close watch incase it comes back)

7. If it didnt work repeat from step 1.

8. If it did work you could go onto anything

<summary><b>Point-Blank</b> Scripts on extension pages</summary>

This exploit allows you to run scripts, on extensions pages, this is a great example of how Chromebooks are a piece of garbage.

<i>Getting started</i>
(Note: if bookmarklets are blocked your screwed.)

1. Go to <a href="https://spot-maze-chinchilla.glitch.me/ingot.js">here</a> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3kh0/ext-remover/main/newpointblank.js">if blocked</a> on your school chromebook.

2. Make a bookmark with the code there.

3. Once that is done,

 If you have Securly go to <a href="https://tinyurl.com/bettergoofcurly">here</a> if it says blocked by chrome, reload (you have to actually have securly ofc)
 
 If you have iBoss go to <a href="https://tinyurl.com/goofboss">here</a>.
 
 If you have Cisco Umbrella go to <a href="https://tinyurl.com/goofumbrella">here</a>.
 
 If you have Blocksi go to <a href="https://tinyurl.com/goofsi">here</a>.
 
 And if you have GoGuardian(might not work) go to <a href="https://tinyurl.com/goofguardian">here</a>. 
 
 Now most of these links are a block page(this is intentional) on each page should have a blue link, click the link on the page if it opens a blank page click the bookmarklet that you just made and click either hard disable or soft disable, you can also run some of the scripts and run your own code, your extension may disable javascript being ran on it, so running your own code may not work.
 
**Extra notes**
- I recommend doing soft disable, which only disables it until restart. 
- The launcher was made by 3kh0, but the idea was from <a href="https://bolg.glitch.me/_/point-blank/">Bypassi#7037</a>
- If your school updated GoGuardian, this exploit may not work.

<summary><b>CAUB</b> Prevent Updates</summary>

This exploit keeps your chromebook downgraded (or on the current version) without automatic updates screwing you over. This exploit was found by Catakang#0987. Using onc files, you can convince your chromebook that the wifi that you're connected to is pay-to-use (like a hotspot using data), and thus it will not check for updates.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58097612/212685932-ef9c802e-6040-42a3-be6e-10997162b7cd.png)

<i>Getting started</i>

1. Go to `chrome://network#state` (on your school chromebook of course; if this is blocked then ur kinda screwed lol).
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page; you should see a list of "favorite" wifis that you've connected to in the past.
3. Click the `+` sign next to the wifi name of each network that you commonly connect your chromebook to.
4. The more wifis you expand, the better, but note that they have to come from the "favorites" section.
5. Use ctrl+a and ctrl+c to copy all the text on the entire network#state page.
6. Go to <a href="https://c-a-u-b.glitch.me">caub.glitch.me</a>.
7. Paste the copied text into the textbox bshelow.
8. Press the `generate onc` button below the textbox.
9. Once you have downloaded the file, go to `chrome://network#general`.
10. Click on the `import onc` button.
11. Import the newly downloaded file.

**Extra notes**
- Your chromebook will no longer automatically update. (as long as you are on a wifi that you used caub on)
- Be careful not to stay on a wifi for too long without using caub on it, otherwise you might update.
- We cannot guarantee that this will work on every wifi

<summary><b>LTBEEF inspect</b> Using inspect to disable extensions</summary>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58097612/207386423-e6aa2095-d92d-44a8-a3d6-e42066bdf34e.png)

The screenshot below was preformed on `108.0.5359.75` (Official Build) (64-bit) on the stable channel. This has been tested and does work but has varying levels of success, you will need access to inspect element, more specifically, console.

1. Open this on your chromebook: 
```
chrome-extension://gndmhdcefbhlchkhipcnnbkcmicncehk/manifest.json
``` 
Shortened link: https://tinyurl.com/i-ltbeef
2. Open inspect and navigate to the console tab.
3. Run the basic LTBEEF code such as
```js
chrome.management.setEnabled('extensionid', false)
```

<summary><b>Blank3r</b> Reload extensions continuously</summary>

Point Blank is an exploit that allows you to run bookmarklets on privileged pages, such as the Chrome extensions page. This exploit was made with Point Blank as well.

You can either use the prompt or the gui the prompt is below

1. Bookmark this code:

```js
javascript:let shim = false;var ids = prompt("extension ids (comma separated)").split(",");setInterval(()=>{ids.forEach((id)=> opener.chrome.developerPrivate.updateExtensionConfiguration({extensionId: id, fileAccess: shim}));shim = !shim;}, 145);
```

And the gui is in launcher.js


2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`.

3. Click on a extension that YOU installed from the Chrome Web Store > Details.

4. In the URL bar, copy the string of letters and numbers after the `/?id=`.

5. Click "View in Chrome Web Store" and spam the excape key. If it loads into chrome webstore try again, if it is a blank screen click the bookmarklet.

5. Paste the id of the extension into the prompt or input box seperated by commas.

If you close the tab, the exploit will stop working.

<summary><b>Pencil Method</b> Unenroll by bridging pins on the motherboard</summary>

**This can harm your Chromebook if done incorrectly. Use at your own risk.**

**Unenrolling by bridging pins on the motherboard.**

The   <a href="https://blog.darkn.bio/blog/3-the-tsunami#bypassing-instructions">proper guide</a> was created by Darkn.

## Requirements

- Conductive material (staple, tin foil, paperclip, etc.)
- Scissors
- Tape (optional, recommended)
- USB drive or SD card with Sh1mmer flashed
- Screwdriver corresponding to the screws of your Chromebook

## Dismantling Hardware & Bridging Pins

**Instructions**

1. With a screwdriver, remove each screw from the bottom of your Chromebook.

2. Disconnect the battery. The battery cable placement varies between models.

3. On the motherboard, find the 8-pin chip with pins sticking out or in. It likely has winbond or GigaDevice branding, and it may show 25Q64[xx] or 25Q128[xx] below the branding. It may be located on the back of the motherboard.

4. Shape a piece of your conductive material long enough to connect to both sides of the chip and small enough to not make contact with multiple pins on either side of the chip.

5. Place one end of the conductive material on pin 3 (WP).

6. Place the other end of the conductive material on pin 8 (VCC).

7. If necessary, place tape on top of the chip to keep the conductive material on the pins.

8. Connect the battery.

## Performing the Exploit

**Instructions**

1. Boot into Sh1mmer with the USB.

2. In the Sh1mmer menu, navigate to Utilities.

3. Select **Un-Enroll Device**. This is necessary even if the process fails.

4. In the **Utilities** menu, select **Open Bash**.

5. In the bash shell, run the following commands:

`flashrom --wp-disable
/usr/share/vboot/bin/set_gbb_flags.sh 0x8090`

If the commands fail, the pins are not bridged correctly.

6. Reboot the Chromebook by pressing **Refresh** ↻ + **Power** ⏻.

7. Press **Ctrl + D** to bypass the OS verification screen.

8. Boot into Chrome OS.

9. Press **Ctrl** + **Alt** + **F2** to enter the VT2 shell.

10. Log in to the shell as **root**.

11. Run the following commands:

`tpm_manager_client take_ownership
cryptohome --action=remove_firmware_management_parameters`

12. Press **Ctrl** + **Alt** + **F1** to exit the VT2 shell.

13. Press **Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R**.

14. Click **Powerwash**.

<summary><b>CryptoSmite</b> Unenrollment</summary>

**CryptoSmite** is an exploit capable of completely unenrolling enterprise-managed Chromebooks. It was found by FWSmasher and released on **March 9th, 2024**.

**This exploit has been patched since Chrome OS 120.**

### Finding Kernver
If you're on v120 or higher, you need to downgrade in order to use CryptoSmite. To do this, you first need to check your `kernver=` in Recovery Mode.

1. Boot into Recovery Mode
   - Hold ESC + Refresh + Power for 2 or 3 seconds.
   - You should be on an "Insert Recovery Media" or "Let's step you through the recovery process" screen.
2. Press TAB and look at the last digit of the `kernver=` line

- `kernver=` ends with a 2! <br />
Congratulations, you can downgrade to v119 or lower! Follow the instructions at [Downgrading *Change versions*](#downgrading-change-versions) on how to downgrade.

- `kernver=` ends with a 3! <br />
Sorry, you can't downgrade to v119 or lower. Wait for a new unenrollment exploit or do a <a href="https://blog.darkn.bio/blog/3-the-tsunami">**dangerous** hardware modification</a>.

### Using CryptoSmite
1. Download a SH1MMER Prebuilt image here: <a href="dl.darkn.bio">https://dl.darkn.bio/SH1mmer/Prebuilt/</a>
2. Disable OS verification *(blocked or not, doesn't matter)*, and boot into the shim.
3. Navigate to Payloads and navigate to CryptoSmite using the arrow keys, then press `Enter`.
4. Type in `Y` then press enter, and it'll automatically reboot upon completion.
5. Proceed through the setup partially till you get to the Add Account Screen.
   - If you see an update prompt, reboot then press `CTRL + ALT + E` on the Wi-Fi screen.
     - This *should* allow skipping the update, or make it not appear at all.
6. Powerwash the Chromebook at the "Add Account" screen. Afterwards, it'll be fully unenrolled.

<summary><b>SH1mmer V111 → V113</b> Unenrollment</summary>
How to use SH1MMER on v111 → v113
(if you're willing to take the back cover off your Chromebook)

you'll only need to do this once, and it will let you use SH1MMER even after it's been completely patched



        1. Unplug everything, open the back panel, disconnect the battery to disable WP, plug in the charger
        2. boot into SH1MMER and use "Un-Enroll / Deprovision" (yes I know it will show an error, but that doesn't
        matter)
        (you will also need to run "Disable block_devmode" if you're using the old legacy version)
        3. go to the bash shell and run this command:
        /usr/share/vboot/bin/set_gbb_flags.sh 0x8090
        do not use "Reset GBB Flags" after this

        4. exit SH1MMER, unplug everything, reconnect the battery, reconnect the charger
        5. boot up, press CTRL + D to enter developer mode
        6. once it completes, use CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + R to powerwash
        7. after powerwash, immediately go into VT2 by pressing CTRL + ALT + F2 (→), login as "root" and run these commands:
        tpm_manager_client take_ownership
        cryptohome --action=remove_firmware_management_parameters
        if it fails, try downgrading to v110 if possible. if you can't, use E-Halycon instead.
        8. press CTRL + ALT + F1 (←), use CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + R to powerwash again
        9. profit

        NOTE: if you're on dedede, your WP method is probably different. look your model up online to find the WP
        method.

<summary><b>E-Halcyon</b> Unenrollment Or Downgrade</summary>

First of all, you'll need a linux PC or VM. WSL is not guaranteed to work

Now, you'll need to boot into SH1MMER, and press the Un-Enroll option. It won't truly unenroll you if you've received the 112 update patching unenrollment and downgrading, but it is still a necessary step for the rest of this. If you've never used SH1MMER before or don't have an image lying around, make sure to follow all the instructions on sh1mmer.me for unenrollment before proceeding with the rest of the tutorial here

Next, you need a version 107 recovery image corresponding to your board, which you can pick up from chrome100.dev. Once you've downloaded the right image for your board and have confirmed it's for version 107, unzip it and save it to a safe place. Now open up a terminal and type in the following commands (make sure to replace /path/to/recovery/image.bin with the actual path)

```
git clone https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/RecoMod
cd RecoMod
chmod +x recomod.sh
sudo ./recomod.sh -i /path/to/recovery/image.bin --halcyon --rw_legacy
```

The script will modify the image in place, and it can now be flashed with a standard recovery tool onto a USB of your choice.

Enable developer mode and get to the dev mode block screen similarly to how you would with SH1MMER, then plug in the USB. The recovery screen will show up, and at this point you need to start spamming the E key on your keyboard. It will begin a 5 minute wait sequence, and near the end of the 5 minutes start spamming E again. You will only have to wait 5 minutes once, subsequent boots will have the 5 minute wait omitted

The boot splash will show, and you will enter a special menu. Use arrow keys to navigate the cursor down to "activate halcyon environment" and press enter. Then navigate down to "Install halcyon semi-tethered" and wait for it to finish. Once it's finished, go back to "activate halcyon environment" and press "Boot halcyon semi-tethered". and you will be booted into a downgraded and unenrolled ChromeOS environment.

FAQ:
How does this work?
See the writeup for more information

Can the admins see that I'm doing this?
No.

Why don't my history/cookies/etc save after a reboot?
Unfixable restriction of cryptohome. See the writeup for more information

Why is my Chromebook "Missing or damaged?"
After installing E-Halcyon, you won't be able to boot Chrome OS normally. You'll have to keep the usb around to jumpstart the booting process

Where do I report bugs?
The RecoMod GitHub

Why does it say "E mode not activated" when I try to boot halcyon?
You spammed the E key when starting at the wrong time, or not at all

<summary><b>TerraOS</b> Linux from RMA shim</summary>

1. Clone the <a href="https://github.com/r58Playz/terraos">TerraOS repository</a>.

Run `git clone https://github.com/r58Playz/terraos.git` in a terminal.

2. Create a build directory in the cloned directory.

3. Run `bash ../scripts/build_stage1.sh <defconfig>` in the terminal.
- Use terraos as the defconfig if building for x86_64 Chromebooks.
- Use `terraos_jacuzzi` as the defconfig if building for `jacuzzi` board Chromebooks.
- Support for `jacuzzi` boards is experimental and may not work.

4. Run bash ../scripts/build_aur_packages.sh in the terminal.

5. Run
`bash ../scripts/build_all.sh <shim.bin> <board_recovery.bin>
<reven_recovery.bin>`
in the terminal, replacing `<shim.bin>` with the path to a shim for your board, `<board_recovery.bin>` with the path to a recovery image for your board, and `<reven_recovery.bin>` with the path to a Chrome OS Flex recovery of the same version. This places a built bootloader image, SquashFS and tarballs of the arch RootFS, a bootloader image with the arch Rootfs, a bootloader image with TerraOS Chrome OS, and a bootloader image with both the arch RootFS and TerraOS Chrome OS in the build directory.

The default arch RootFS user and password are `terraos`.

4. Now visit <a href="https://tinyurl.com/AddSession">tinyurl.com/AddSession</a> or <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/identifier?hl=en&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&ec=GAlAmgQ&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=AddSession">this link</a>
5. Add your **SCHOOL** account back. It WILL NOT WORK if you add a home account back. This is just so you can still access Google Drive, Youtube, and any Google service.
6. All extensions should stop working.
7. Note that you have to repeat this every time you restart or sign out.
8. If the link gets patched and you no longer see the blue button, go to `chrome://settings/resetProfileSettings` click current settings, it'll open a blank page, on that page run 
```js
javascript:opener.chrome.send("TurnOffSync");
```
And visit `chrome://restart`.

Workaround for `chrome://settings/signOut` and `javascript:opener.chrome.send("TurnOffSync");` if both patched: Just go to `chrome://settings/syncSetup/advanced` and click 
Customize sync and then flip off the Extensions and Apps or just flip off everything exept for bookmarks

<summary><b>OP Crosh</b> Disable extensions with crosh and vmc</summary>

### Requirements
- A managed Chromebook with crosh enabled
- The `VmManagementCliAllowed` policy either `unset` or `set` to true
- Some form of removable media for noting down extension IDs (only useful for the second method and not required, but this prevents you from mistyping an extension ID).
- A willingness to powerwash

### There are two variations to this method:
1. Disabling all extensions. This is probably the most reliable, but you'd be left without useful extensions such as any adblockers. You also aren't able to install anything from the Chrome Web Store either.

2. Disabling specific extensions. This is less reliable, since this only becomes possible once Chrome OS has installed at least one extension already, which could be one that you're trying to disable.

### Testing if the method is possible:
1. Open crosh by hitting `ctrl`+`alt`+`t`
. If a command line pops up then you have crosh enabled and you can move on to step 2.

2. Test the `VmManagementCliAllowed` policy by running the `vmc` command. If a list of subcommands is shown, then you're good to go.

### Instructions:
1. Back up any data you want before the powerwash.

2. If you're doing the second variation, note down any extension IDs. You may also want to do this if you intend on disabling all extensions, since sometimes that will fail and require you to specify each extension you want to disable.

3. Powerwash by attempting to enable developer mode. Instructions are available <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/developer_mode.md#dev-mode">here</a>.

4. Log into your Google account as normal, but immediately disable your internet right after you sign in.

5. You should be logged into your account, but without any extensions installed due to being offline.

6. Here the instructions are split, so follow the one for the method that you want to do.
 
### Disable All Extensions:
1. Open up crosh by hitting `ctrl`+`alt`+`t`

2. Type in `vmc create-extra-disk --size 1 /home/chronos/user/Extensions`

3. Run that command.

4. If it fails with a "file exists" error, then you must individually specify each extension that you want to remove. Move to step 5 of the next section to do that.

5. Re-enable your internet, and no extensions should be installed.
 

### Disable Specific Extensions:
1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`.

2. Enable your internet, and immediately disable it when an extension is installed.

3. Assuming the installed extension was not one that you were trying to disable, move on to step 4. If it was, you'd have to powerwash to try again.

4. Open up crosh by hitting `ctrl`+`alt`+`t`.

5. For each extension you want to disable, run this command: `vmc create-extra-disk --size 1 /home/chronos/user/Extensions/{extension_id}`

6. Each command should look something like this: `vmc create-extra-disk --size 1 /home/chronos/user/Extensions/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm`

7. Re-enable your internet, and if you typed/pasted in the extension IDs correctly, those specific extensions should be blocked from ever being installed.

<summary><b>Filter session bypass</b> Bypass hapara filter session</summary>

During a filter session, right click the link, and press "Open in a new tab"
Then insert the URL for any website you want to go to.  Make sure to include https://<br>

<summary><b>Hapara Lock Screen Bypass</b> Bypass Hapara Lock Screen</summary>

1. Make bookmarks of pages you want to visit beforehand.

2. Once your screen is paused, spam unfullscreen. Each time you do, you should see your tabs and bookmark bar come back. Attempt to right-click on the bookmarks bar until a menu shows up.

3. In the menu, select “Add folder”. Name it whatever you like. Hit Done. With luck, your tabs and bookmarks should stay at the top of your screen. If not, try again.

4. Once the tab and bookmarks bar stays, spam-click one of the bookmarks you made. This lags Hapara into displaying your page instead of the pause page. Turn off your wifi as soon as the page fully loads. This stops data flow between your amd the teacher’s computer, so that they can’t re-pause your screen.

<summary><b>Google Forms Locked Mode Bypass</b> </summary>

**Patched On Newer Versions**

If you don't have the ability to enable flags this won't work. You can use a Chrome flag to use Google while being within a locked google form, no notifications will be sent to your teacher. You must enable the Chrome flag named window-layout-menu by visiting `chrome://flags/#window-layout-menu` and selecting enabled. Before entering a form, first create a new window and hold your cursor over the maximize button; This will open a menu, in this menu pin the window You can now enter the Google form in the non-floating window, the floating window will stay as an overlay on top of your form. 

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT close/minimize the floating window while in the form as it will cause the window to not be able to be opened anymore while staying in the form. If a teacher comes close, u can just drag the window to the corner so they dont see lmao.

<summary><b>Google Forms Locked Mode Bypass 2</b> </summary>

# Another Google Forms Locked Mode Bypass
*This is for educational purposes only, use only on forms that you own*
## How does this work?
So, you want to know how the genie does his tricks, eh?  Well, I'll tell you.
1. Google is dumb
2. They forgot to add any checks to make sure locked mode is actually enabled 💀
3. All that happens when you open a locked Google Form is that it submits a form via POST request that responds with the test (which would usually be locked, but we skipped the part where it tells Chrome to lock itself)
4. The token sent with the POST request is easily scraped from the form login page

## What potential is there for issues by using this?
1. Every time you make the POST request after the first time, Google emails the owner of the form
2. The form object on the page gets deleted when the "visibilitychanged" event is fired
2a. The "visibilitychanged" event is only fired by complete obfuscation, not partial or loss of focus.
3. You're screwed if you don't follow the directions to the T
